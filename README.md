# 🌧️ Is It Raining On Me Right Now?

The most useless weather app ever created! Find out if it's raining on you... but you have to be outside to check it.

## 🎯 Core Features

- **Big Dramatic Button**: "IS IT RAINING ON ME?" button that does exactly what it says
- **Precise Geolocation**: Uses your exact coordinates to check if it's raining
- **Weather API Integration**: Calls Open-Meteo API for real-time weather data
- **Dramatic Results**: Displays results in the most over-the-top way possible

## 🎭 The Useless Twists

1. **Light Sensor Check**: Uses your phone's light sensor - if it detects you're indoors (low light), it refuses to work with "ERROR: Please go outside to check if it's raining"

2. **Motion Detection**: Requires you to shake your phone while outside to "activate rain detection"

3. **Overly Specific Location**: Shows messages like "It is raining on you at 55.9533°N, 3.1883°W but NOT raining 2 meters to your left"

## 🚀 Peak Uselessness Enhancements

- **Historical Feature**: "It was raining on you 5 minutes ago" (completely unhelpful)
- **Favorite Rain Locations**: Save all your favorite places where it rained
- **Social Media Sharing**: Share "It's raining on me right now!" with timestamp
- **Premium Feature**: "Is it going to rain on me in 5 seconds?" (costs $0.99 - just kidding!)
- **Rain Notifications**: Get alerted when it's raining... while you're already outside in the rain
